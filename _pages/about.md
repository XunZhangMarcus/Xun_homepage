Research : As a student who is pursuing a master's degree in Hydraulic Engineering, I am trying to discover a more creative fusion between Data Science and Hydrogeology. My main interests focus on model-data integration for hydrogeology, deep learning-based inverse methods for estimating groundwater parameters .                   
Previously : I received my Bachelor’s degree in Water conservancy and Hydraulic Engineering from Northwest A&F University
